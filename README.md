# Logistic regression model for predictions

In this project, I built and trained logistic regression model using TensorFlow, PyTorch and Scikit-Learn library. This project has large league of legends dataset with 9 columns and 1000 rows. `win` is the target feature and `kills, deaths, assists, gold-earned, cs, wards_placed, wards_killed, damage_dealt` are input features.
    

## Introduction  

League of Legends, a popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game, generates extensive data from matches, providing an excellent opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to real-world scenarios. Performed the following steps to build a logistic regression model aimed at predicting the outcomes of League of Legends matches.

## Following steps are performed in the project
- Step 1: Load the League of Legends dataset and preprocess it for training
- Step 2: Implement a logistic regression model using PyTorch
- Step 3: Train the logistic regression model on the dataset
- Step 4: Implement optimization techniques and evaluate the model's performance
- Step 5: Visualization and Interpretation
- Step 6: Save and load the trained model
- Step 7: Perform hyperparameter tuning to find the best learning rate
- Step 8: Evaluate feature importance to understand the impact of each feature on the prediction

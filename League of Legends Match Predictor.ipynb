    "League of Legends, a popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game, generates extensive data from matches, providing an excellent opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to real-world scenarios. Performed the following steps to build a logistic regression model aimed at predicting the outcomes of League of Legends matches.  \n",

    "2.Creating a DataFrame:\n",
    "  - Created a pandas DataFrame with two columns: one for the feature names and the other for their corresponding importance values (i.e., the learned weights).\n",
    "  - Ensured the features are aligned with their names in the dataset (e.g., `X_train.columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Sorting and Plotting Feature Importance:\n",
    "  - Sorted the features based on the absolute value of their importance (weights) to identify the most impactful features.\n",
    "  - Used a bar plot (via `matplotlib`) to visualize the sorted feature importances, with the feature names on the y-axis and importance values on the x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Interpreting the Results:\n",
    "  - Larger absolute weights indicate more influential features. Positive weights suggest a positive correlation with the outcome (likely to predict the positive class), while negative weights suggest the opposite."
